Udacity LSTM Practice

This codes is for the practicing of LSTM. All credits are to [Udacity](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/6_lstm.ipynb) and the [ref](https://github.com/rndbrtrnd/udacity-deep-learning/blob/master/6_lstm.ipynb) here.

See ".ipynb" files

Also, you can see "SparseVectorEmbeddings.ipynb" for my explaination of **"Embeddings"** and **"Encoder--Decoder structure"**. (only in Chinese)
